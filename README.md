# Become a Software professional 2023

## Week 01
In the first week, we learned how to use Figma and worked on the problem of the week as a group.

## Week 02
We individually created an HTML document that has the same content as the landing page from the screenflow we made in Figma the previous week.

## Week 03
This week we styled the HTML created last week using CSS without using flexbox, referencing the aesthetics used in Figma in the first week.
